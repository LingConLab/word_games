# Combiner

Combiner is a game whose essence is to find all the words that can be made up of the letters of the original word.

Combiner requires two arguments:

1. dictionary, an argument of string type whose value is a path to csv file containing words and organised in the next way:

```

2. random_word, an argument of boolean type. If it is set to True, source word will be chosen randomly on the start of game, otherwise it must be entered manually.

# Wordle

Wordle is a word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. When player starts a new game, they are presented with a blank space where they can input your guesses. Player can type in a word of the same length as hidden word as their guess, and the game provides feedback on each letter's position in the hidden word.

Wordle requires a bunch of arguments:

1. dictionary, an argument of string type whose value is a path to csv file containing words and organised in the next way:

```
word_1, word_2, etc.
```

2. keyboard, an argument of string type whose value is a path to csv file containing lines of symbols to build a keyboard with them and organised in the next way:

```
qwertyuiop, asdfghjkl, etc.
```

3. size, an argument of integer type whose value will define the leng—Ät of hidden words and, therefore, of all words that can be entered

7. no_word_in_dictionary_error, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they try to enter a word not presented in dictionary

8. word_is_too_short_error, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they try to enter a word containing less letters then number in the size variable

9. word_is_too_long_error, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they press a keyboard letter button, when there are no empty cells in the word field

10. victory_outcome, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they manage to guess the hidden word in a number of attempts not exceeding the number in the tries variable

11. lose_outcome, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they don't manage to guess the hidden word in a number of attempts not exceeding the number in the tries variable
