    Wordle is a word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. When player starts a new game, they are presented with a blank space where they can input your guesses. Player can type in a word of the same length as hidden word as their guess, and the game provides feedback on each letter's position in the hidden word.

    Wordle requires a bunch of arguments:

    :dictionary:, an argument of string type whose value is a path to csv file containing words and organised in the next way:
        word_1, word_2, etc.
    :keyboard:, an argument of string type whose value is a path to csv file containing lines of symbols to build a keyboard with them and organised in the next way:
        qwertyuiop, asdfghjkl, etc.
    :size:, an argument of integer type whose value will define the leng—Ät of hidden words and, therefore, of all words that can be entered

    :number of tries:, an argument of integer type whose value will define the number of attempts player will have unless game will conclude win or lose

    :direction:, an argument of string type whose value can be either "left_to_right" or "right_to_left". It defines the direction of writing system

    :nothing_to_delete_error:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they press backspace on empty word field

    :no_word_in_dictionary_error:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they try to enter a word not presented in dictionary

    :word_is_too_short_error:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they try to enter a word containing less letters then number in the size variable

    :word_is_too_long_error:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they press a keyboard letter button, when there are no empty cells in the word field

    :victory_outcome:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they manage to guess the hidden word in a number of attempts not exceeding the number in the tries variable

    :lose_outcome:, an argument of string type whose value will be shown as alert on the player's screen, if they don't manage to guess the hidden word in a number of attempts not exceeding the number in the tries variable
